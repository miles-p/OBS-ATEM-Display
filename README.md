# OBS-ATEM-Display
A HUD for OBS to replicate the ATEM Mini Vision Mixer from BlackMagic Design

Hi everyone,
Developer Miles Here,

I wrote this software for use with OBS, more specifically the Multiview mode. The software puts the time and cpu usage in the bottom row of boxes, as a HUD (heads up display).
The software uses the Tkinter library for Python, as well as the DateTime module, psutil library, and threading for juggling tasks.

The software is very simple but is very versatile. The software is open-source and is free for anyone and everyone. Mod it? It doesn't matter to me. Share it? Cool. Use it? Even better!

You may need to run 'pip install psutil' due to it being missing from most installations of Python.

THANKS!
